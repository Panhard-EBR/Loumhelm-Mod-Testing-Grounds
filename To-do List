//To-do List//

Priority 1: Add nations and Policies and balance.
Reason: Very self-explanatory, the nations make the meat of the mod and the policies are meant to enhance them.
        I will balance on the fly as I create a nation, they are subject to constantly change as I add things.

Nations to add:
1. Elvin Imperial State - ✓
2. Sentinal Union, 1st Core - ✓
3. Jirbalimah Emirate - X
4. Shillaelah Revolutionary State - X
5. Elvin Empire Remnants - X
6. Sentinal Union, 4th Core - X
7. The Salamander Enclave - X
8. Atomic Core - ×
9. Teltec - X
10. Ducca Iltanate - X
More to be potentially added...

Policies to add:
1. Imperialism and Progress - ✓
2. Warmonger - ✓
3. The Winds of Prosperity - X
4. Desires of Freedom - X
5. Broken Dreams Remade - X
6. Prepare for Anything - X
7. Tides of Wrath - X
8. Shadows Beneath Karma - ×
9. Warpath - X
10. Shattering Winds - X
More to be potentially added...


Priority 2: Make sprites and add units and buildings.
Reason: While graphics enhance a game, the game has to be in a playable state for those graphics to work well, so I'll work on them when the gameplay is in a near finished state.
        Units and buildings are second priority because I don't have much experience in making them yet, I'll dedicate work on buildings first when I'm done with the first 4 nations.

Priority 3: Music.
        Very self-explanatory.
        To save space, and time, since I use a phone and have to redownload the mod when I want a change, music will be a separate mod to download.
