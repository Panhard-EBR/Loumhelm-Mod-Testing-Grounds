# Loumhelm: Empire's Imitator (Unfinished)
*THIS MOD IS NOT IN A PROPER PLAYABLE STATE*


This is my very first mod for this game.
I just downloaded it a little while ago and when I found out that you can mod it, I immediately tried to make one.

While making mods on mobile was not recommended, I did it anyway because I don't have a PC.
And now here we are.

Anyways, I plan to add:

about 8+ nations\factions. (subject to change)
Each of them will have a great upside, but also a downside to balance things out.

+E.G. The Elvin Imperial State having more unit strength, science production and gold, but has attributes that weaken the expansion and growth of cities and reduced happiness for every city.

Or the 1st Core having more production, faster experience gain, ignore terrain defense and good base happiness, but they grow slightly slower, have no terrain defense and most things are a little more expensive.

*There is one thing I need to make clear*:      I'm not an expert at this game, if a faction is too weak or strong, I will tweak them based on my current knowledge, but I would also like suggestions from anyone more knowledgeable.

I also plan to make new policies that are for specific nations.

+As with any other mod, each faction will have exclusive units and buildings.
That's really all I have to say for now.


Notes: This mod hasn't been properly balanced yet and there are quite a few things that don't work.
Also images are going to be added when a sufficient amount of content is added, desirably, when it's mostly finished.
